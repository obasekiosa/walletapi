# Wallet-API

API built with DRF for a telemedicine app to book hospital appointments.

## Authentication
- All end points need authentication to access except `/signin/` and `/signup/`.
- Get your token from the `/signin/` endpoint, after you have signed up and add it to the request headers.
```python
    Authorization : 'Bearer ' + jwt_token
```
- You are good to go. üëçüèæ
